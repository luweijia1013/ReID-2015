### `Notice`:
#### Code for CUHK03 has already been updated. It should be able to be trained now. More detail see the README.
### Test Environment:
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Python 2.7.12
* TensorFlow 1.1
* Keras 2.0
* CUDA 8.0
* cudnn 5.1
* NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti
---
### Things to do:
* Add some comment to the code for CUHK03.
* Refactor the Data Preparation and Training Routine part of the code.
* Show the Test Result Form.
* Share the trained model to reproduce the test result with Baidu Drive or Google Drive.
* Same to the code for Market-1501.

Implementation for CVPR 2015 Paper: "An Improved Deep Learning Architecture for Person Re-Identification".

[`Paper link`](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Ahmed_An_Improved_Deep_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf)

This architechture is implemented based on `Keras` with `Tensorflow` backen using `Python` Programming Language.

## Train the model on which dataset?

1. [`Market-1501`](https://github.com/Deep-Learning-Person-Re-Identification/Implementaion-1/tree/master/market1501)

2. [`CUHK-03`](https://github.com/Deep-Learning-Person-Re-Identification/Implementaion-1/tree/master/CUHK03)
